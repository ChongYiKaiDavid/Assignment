Project Focus
The focus of this project is to give the "Kpop Merchzzz" website a more professional and engaging look. Kpop Merchzzz is a platform dedicated to offering high-quality merchandise from popular K-pop groups. The website aims to attract fans of all ages, especially younger generations, who are drawn to visually appealing and user-friendly platforms.

While the existing site's UX is functional, its UI feels basic and uninspired. The goal of this project is to transform it into a vibrant, professional, and inviting online store that reflects the dynamic energy of the K-pop industry.

Design Process
The design process centers on improving the UI of the website. While the UX is satisfactory, the main focus is on refining the websiteâ€™s aesthetics. The revamped website is designed to captivate the younger audience, aligning with their preference for modern, sleek designs.

Features
The updated website consists of seven main pages:

Home Page: Showcases the site's core philosophy, promotions, and updates like new outlet openings.
About Us: Provides insight into the brand's mission and vision.
Products: Displays a detailed catalog of merchandise, allowing users to explore various offerings.
Collections: Highlights themed collections or exclusive collaborations.
Find & Contact: Lists store locations and provides a contact form.
Careers: Shares job opportunities within the company.
Feedback: Allows users to share their feedback directly.
Key Improvements

Enhanced Navigational Panel and Footer for smoother browsing.
Consistent Banners and promotional graphics that reflect the brand's vibrancy.
Improved Products Page for seamless product exploration.
Revamped Icons for a cohesive design language.
Added Feedback Page for customer engagement.
An additional feature under consideration is an online shopping page for purchasing merchandise, akin to major retail apps. This could be a future implementation depending on resources.

Technologies Used
The website is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, leveraging responsive design principles for optimal user experience across devices.
